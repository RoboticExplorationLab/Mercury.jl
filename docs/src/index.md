# Mercury

## Overview
Mercury.jl is a light-weight message passing system for robotics applications built 
on top of [ZMQ.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/ZMQ.jl) and [ProtoBuf.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/ProtoBuf.jl). It's main goal is to provide a fast and efficient 
method for setting up autonomy stacks on embedded systems or microcomputers. 

This project is still in early development by the [Robotic Exploration Lab](https://roboticexplorationlab.org) at Carnegie Mellon University. The package will be registered 
as an official Julia package as soon as we get it working reliably on real hardware.
